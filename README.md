This repo contains material for a course for teaching Haskell and functional programming.

In this course we will learn Haskell by building small functional programming languages in Haskell. The languages will start out very small, and their implementations naive. But, the languages near the end of the course should hopefully support a nice subset of the features in Haskell, and the implementations of those languages will use more a more idiomatic Haskell style (and use more features).

TODO:

  * Add unit tests for AE and move file to AEUnitTests.hs.
  * Consider adding doctests for AE.
  * Consider what exercises to create for AE.
  * Consider the next programming language after AE.
  * Fill out this README file with a lot more info.
  * Document Parsing.hs (or at least say Here Be Dragons.)
  * Document Util.hs
  * A bunch more.
